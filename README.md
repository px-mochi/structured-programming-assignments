# structured-programming-assignments

Hi there! This repo consists of snippets of work that I have done for my school assignments (specifically, ICT133), which challenged my very beginner skill with (the not object oriented parts of) Python.

Here is a short description of what is in this repo:
## Basic text based visual calculator that adds two 3 digit numbers
- This was my first foray into understanding text and number formatting in Python
- It was also my first glimpse of the logical thinking needed to break down seemingly easy requirements into code logic

## Finding Greatest Common Denominator 
- The assignment required us to use the software Flowgorithm to generate a flowchart to illustrate the Euclid's algorithm, which is used to calculate the Greatest Common Denominator.
- Flowgorithm was then used to generate source code in [Python](Jul_2018_Structured_Programming/greatest_common_denominator.py) and in [Java](Jul_2018_Structured_Programming/greatest_common_denominator.java).
- The original flowchart and code was then [improved on](Jul_2018_Structured_Programming/greatest_common_denominator_improved.py) to
  - Add a counter in the loop, to count number of iterations used 
  - Reduce the number of iterations needed 

## A text based game of mastermind
- [What is this game?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game))
- [Version without the use of python dictionaries](Jul_2018_Structured_Programming/mastermind_game/mastermind_game.py)
- [Version with dictionaries](Jul_2018_Structured_Programming/mastermind_game/mastermind_game_dict.py)
  - The dictionaries are used to record each playerâ€™s name, score for the current game and the number of games won thus far, as well as any other appropriate values.
- The planning of the game was done through use of top-down design.
