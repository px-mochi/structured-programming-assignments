# structured-programming-assignments

Hi there! This repo consists of snippets of work that I have done for my school assignments, which challenged my very beginner skill with (the not object oriented parts of) Python.

Here is a short description of what is in this repo:
## Basic text based visual calculator that adds two 3 digit numbers
> This was my first foray into understanding text and number formatting in Python
> It was also my first glimpse of the logical thinking needed to break down seemingly easy requirements into code logic

## A text based game of mastermind
> [What is this game?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game))
> 

Okay let me save this halfway first
